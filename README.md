# Privacy guides reference material

Most privacy guides episodes published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/sunknudsen) or [PeerTube](https://peertube.sunknudsen.com/video-channels/sunknudsen_channel/videos) donâ€™t need reference material, but when they do, it lands here.

Shout-out to [1984](https://www.1984hosting.com/), [Njalla](https://njal.la/), [rsync.net](https://rsync.net/), [SatoshiLabs](https://satoshilabs.com/) and [Shakepay](https://shakepay.com/) for [supporting](https://sunknudsen.com/donate) the privacy guides. ðŸ™Œ
