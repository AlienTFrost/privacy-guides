# How to benchmark server performance using Speedtest and SysBench

[![How to benchmark server performance using Speedtest and SysBench](how-to-benchmark-server-performance-using-speedtest-and-sysbench.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcq2iZUcQQY "How to benchmark server performance using Speedtest and SysBench")

> Heads-up: Speedtest is known for tracking users therefore it is recommended to run the following benchmark tests on staging servers.

## Requirements

- Virtual private server (VPS) or dedicated server running Debian 10 (buster) or Debian 11 (bullseye)

## Caveats

- When copy/pasting commands that start with `$`, strip out `$` as this character is not part of the command
- When copy/pasting commands that start with `cat << "EOF"`, select all lines at once (from `cat << "EOF"` to `EOF` inclusively) as they are part of the same (single) command

## Setup guide

### Step 1: check if [backports](https://backports.debian.org/) repository is enabled

```shell
cat /etc/apt/sources.list | grep "backports"
```

### Step 2: enable backports repository (required if previous command returned nothing)

> Heads-up: run `cat /etc/debian_version` to find Debian version.

#### Debian 10 (buster)

```shell
cat << "EOF" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main
EOF
apt update
```

#### Debian 11 (bullseye)

```shell
cat << "EOF" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-backports main
EOF
apt update
```

### Step 3: install apt-transport-https, cURL and GnuPG

```shell
apt update
apt install -y apt-transport-https curl gnupg2
```

### Step 4: import [Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/)‚Äôs PGP public key

```shell
curl -fsSL https://packagecloud.io/ookla/speedtest-cli/gpgkey | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/speedtest-cli.gpg
```

### Step 5: enable Speedtest‚Äôs repository

> Heads-up: run `cat /etc/debian_version` to find Debian version.

#### Debian 10 (buster)

```shell
echo -e "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/speedtest-cli.gpg] https://packagecloud.io/ookla/speedtest-cli/debian/ buster main\ndeb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/speedtest-cli.gpg] https://packagecloud.io/ookla/speedtest-cli/debian/ buster main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/speedtest-cli.list
apt update
```

#### Debian 11 (bullseye)

```shell
echo -e "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/speedtest-cli.gpg] https://packagecloud.io/ookla/speedtest-cli/debian/ bullseye main\ndeb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/speedtest-cli.gpg] https://packagecloud.io/ookla/speedtest-cli/debian/ bullseye main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/speedtest-cli.list
apt update
```

### Step 6: install Speedtest and SysBench

```shell
apt install -y speedtest sysbench
```

## Usage guide

### Benchmark network

> Heads-up: depending on iptables or nftables firewall configuration, running following commands may be required.

#### iptables

```shell
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
```

#### nftables

> Heads-up: replace `firewall` if needed (see `nft list ruleset`).

```shell
nft add rule ip firewall output tcp dport http-alt accept
nft add rule ip6 firewall output tcp dport http-alt accept
```

```console
$ speedtest

### Benchmark CPU

> Heads-up: use `--threads` to use multiple cores concurrently.

```console
$ sysbench cpu run
sysbench 1.0.20 (using system LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3)

Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1
Initializing random number generator from current time


Prime numbers limit: 10000
